        My Sweetheart,  
        Seven days. Just seven days, and you’ve completely turned my world upside down in the best way possible. I didn’t think it was possible to feel this much in such a short time, but here I am, head over heels for you.
        Let me start with your smile because, honestly, it’s a work of art. It’s the kind of smile that stops me in my tracks, that makes my heart race a little faster every time I see it. It’s warm, genuine, and so utterly you. When you smile, it’s like the world fades away, and nothing else matters but that moment.
        And your voice? Oh, don’t even get me started. It’s deep and soothing, with just the right mix of charm and confidence. I could listen to you talk about anything and everything for hours. Whether it’s a simple “good morning” or the way you say my name, your voice has this way of making me feel safe, loved, and maybe a little weak in the knees.
        Then there’s your style. Baby, you know how to turn heads. Whether you’re dressed up or just keeping it casual, you carry yourself with this effortless confidence that drives me crazy in the best way. You’re so handsome it should be illegal, and trust me when I say I catch myself staring way more than I should, but can you blame me?
        What gets me most, though, is your heart. You’re so loving, so caring, and so thoughtful in everything you do. You make me feel like I’m the only person in the world that matters, and I can’t even tell you how much that means to me. You’ve been there for me, even in just these few days, through my ups and downs. You see me at my best, my worst, and everything in between, and yet, you’re still here.
        I’ll admit, I see that little jealous streak in you sometimes, and honestly? I kind of love it. It’s cute knowing you care that much, but it’s also a reminder of how deeply you feel for me. That protective, possessive side of you just makes me feel even more cherished.
        You’re not just attractive (though, let’s face it, you’re incredibly attractive). You’re also kind, smart, brave, and so full of life. It’s everything about you — the way you laugh, the way you look at me, the way you make me feel like I’m the most beautiful, loved person in the world.
        Seven days may not seem like a lot to some, but to me, it’s been everything. You’ve shown me more love and care in this short time than I’ve ever known. I can only imagine what the future holds for us because being with you feels so right, so perfect.
        You are, without a doubt, the best thing that’s happened to me. You’re my dream come true, my sunshine, my everything. I can’t wait to see where this journey takes us because I know, as long as it’s with you, it’ll be the most incredible adventure.
        <br><br>
        Forever yours,  
        Hibabo
